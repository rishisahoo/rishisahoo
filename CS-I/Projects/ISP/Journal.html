    <h1>CS-1 Project-ISP</h1>
    <p>Name: Rishi Sahoo</p>
    <p>Date: 2-Jan-23</p>

    <p>I received assistance from: Michael Cat </p>
    <p>I assisted: myself</p>

    <h2>Technical challenges"?</h2>
    <p>In W1034 Conditionals, if we let x equal to 15 and then write a conditional statement where if x mod 2 == 0 then the statement ‘x is even!’ if the result is else the result ‘x is odd!’ is printed. Some of the technical challenges I have come across while working on this is that if you switch else and if then an error occurs. I had the variable change from x to b in the first line of code and also printed out an error since the variable is not named. I also tried to write print instead of print and that also resulted in an error. I overcame this by working through each technical challenge and google</p>

    <h2>Scheduling challenges?</h2>
    <p>As break was finishing up, I was left with a lot of sleep to catch up on because of the holidays and sleeping patterns. As skyward was on maintenance two days ago, I was unable to progress on the tasks. One scheduling challenge I was experiencing was having to balance my homework, ISP, and my projectSTEM tasks. I overcame these challenges by managing my time better and still completing the work.</p>

    <h2>Interpersonal challenges?</h2>
    <p>One of the interpersonal challenges I faced during this week is my family had a gathering of sorts and I had to attend. I was aiding a team member as well which distracted me from working on the ISP task at hand. And the last interpersonal challenge I was facing was the ability to stay focused after long hours. I was having trouble but I overcame them at the last minute.</p>

    <h2>(Software) Development Engineer</h2>
    <p>A software development engineer is a programmer who designs, develops, and maintains software systems. They are responsible for writing and testing code, debugging problems, and integrating software applications and modules. Software development engineers may work on the development of systems software, such as operating systems, or they may work on the development of applications software, such as word processing tools or games.</p>

    <h2>QA Engineer</h2>
    <p>A QA (Quality Assurance) engineer is responsible for ensuring the quality of a software product. This involves designing and implementing tests, debugging and defining corrective actions, reviewing system requirements and tracking quality assurance metrics. The goal of a QA engineer is to find and report defects in the software, and to verify that the software is fit for its intended purpose. QA engineers work closely with developers and may also interact with end users to gather feedback and understand the needs of the target audience.</p>

    <h2>Project Manager</h2>
    <p>A project manager is responsible for planning, organizing, and directing the completion of specific projects for an organization. This may involve setting project timelines, determining budgets, coordinating the efforts of team members, and ensuring that projects are completed on time and within budget. Project managers may work in a variety of industries, including technology, engineering, construction, and business. They may also be responsible for managing relationships with clients and stakeholders, as well as for monitoring and reporting on the progress of projects to upper management.</p>

    <h2>Product Manager</h2>
    <p>A product manager is responsible for the development and success of a specific product within an organization. This may involve conducting market research to determine the need for a product, defining the features and requirements of the product, and working with a team of designers and engineers to bring the product to market. Product managers may also be responsible for pricing, promotion, and distribution of the product, as well as for gathering and analyzing feedback from customers and using it to inform future product development. In addition to overseeing the development and launch of new products, product managers may also be responsible for the ongoing management and growth of existing products.</p>

    <h2>Release Engineer</h2>
    <p>A release engineer is responsible for managing and coordinating the release process for software products. This may involve building and deploying software releases, creating and maintaining release documentation, and working with development and QA teams to ensure that releases are of high quality and meet the needs of the business. Release engineers may also be responsible for setting up and maintaining build and deployment infrastructure, as well as for troubleshooting and resolving issues that arise during the release process. They play a critical role in ensuring that software is delivered to customers on time and in a stable and reliable manner.</p>
