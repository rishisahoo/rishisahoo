   <p>I received assistance from: Ibrahim Deir</p>
   <p>I assisted: myself</p>
   
   <h2>Section 1</h2>
   <h3>Question 1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base</h3>
   <p>The general process to this would be to combine the numbers to create a new value.</p>
  
   <h2>Section 2</h2>
   <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h3>
   <p>If the addened is less than the number in the column then we yeild the number for the higher value</p>

   <h2>Section 3</h2>
   <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h3>
   <p>Factors include the use of letters in place of characters that affect the value of the sum..</p>
   
   <h2>Section 4</h2>
   <h3>Question 1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h3>
   <p>The numbers are based on the place value and that value is the exponent mutiplied by to and added again to find the final sum.</p>   
   
   <h2>What did I learn? What is the "big idea"?</h2>
   <p>I learned that their are various factors when combining numbers with different bases.</p>
   
   <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
   <p>I encountered challlenges when learning binary to decimal conversion.</p>
    
   <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
   <p>This experience could be improved by practicing more.</p>
   
   <h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
   <p>I now realize that practice is important when it comes to computational math.</p>
